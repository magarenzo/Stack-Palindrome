# stack-palindrome
Uses a stack to determine if a string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, capitalization and special characters

---

[*stack_palindrome.java*](https://github.com/magarenzo/stack-palindrome/blob/master/StackPalindrome.java) reads and stores the user's input, removing spaces, ignoring special characters, and changing all leftover characters to lowercase. By pushing to and popping from a stack, the program determines if the remaining string is a palindrome or not, printing the result in standard output to the user and ending the program. The program will also end if an incorrect input is entered by the user.

<h3>Output:</h3>

`Enter a string (spaces, capitalization and special characters will be ignored):`<br><br>`<input> is a palindrome; ending program.
`<br>OR<br>`<input> is not a palindrome; ending program.`<br>OR<br>`Empty input; ending program.`
