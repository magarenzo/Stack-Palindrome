# Stack Palindrome

Uses a stack to determine if a string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, capitalization and special characters

## Overview

`stack_palindrome.java` reads and stores the user's input, removing spaces, ignoring special characters, and changing all leftover characters to lowercase. By pushing to and popping from a stack, the program determines if the remaining string is a palindrome or not, printing the result in standard output to the user and ending the program. The program will also end if an incorrect input is entered by the user

### Output

```
Enter a string (spaces, capitalization and special characters will be ignored):

<input> is a palindrome; ending program.

OR

<input> is not a palindrome; ending program.

OR

Empty input; ending program.
```
